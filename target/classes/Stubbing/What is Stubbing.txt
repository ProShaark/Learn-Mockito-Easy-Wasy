What is Stubbing?

One of the primary benefit of Mockito is ability to return a provided
response when a specific method is called on mocked dependency.

The process of writing how a given mock method should behave is
called stubbing.

The feature is performed in two ways-

â–¸Using Mockito's static method when()+then Return().It states that
'when'any specific method is called on mock object,'then return'
preconfigured value.

Using Mockito's static method doReturn()+when().It states that'do
return'preconfigured value,'when'specific method is called on
mock object.

Tips
Mockito uses equals()method while matching arguments during
stubbing.
In case response is not stubbed foramethod,default values are
returned when called.
For primitives-0is returned.
For boolean false is returned.
For Objects and Arrays-null is returned.
For Collections-empty collections is returned.

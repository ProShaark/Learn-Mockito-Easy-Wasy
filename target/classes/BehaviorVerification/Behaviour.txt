What is Behavior Verification?

One of the primary benefit of Mock object is that once it gets created,
it remembers all operations performed on it.

Behavior verification help us in verifying that certain mock method was
called by System Under Test or not.

It is done by using verify()method.

Usage-verify(bookRepository).save(book);

The verify()method checks ifagiven method was called once and only
once with given arguments.

It uses equals()method to compare the arguments and verify that
mock method was called with proper arguments.

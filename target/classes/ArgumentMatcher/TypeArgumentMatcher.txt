Argument Matcher


One of the primary benefit of Mockito is ability to perform stubbing of method and behavior verification.

Mockito uses equals() method to compare the argument and verify that mock method was called with poper arguments

Argument Matcher are like wildcards where instead of specific input we can specify range or type of input
